# Dotfiles
My most important config files

## Distro
I used arch previously. Today i'm running xfce Mint, with i3.\

## Nvim
I used packer, but because it got discontinued and lazy is now the big
think, i've updated my distro to it. I don't feel like using other editors now. 

## Kitty
Kitty is simpler than alacritty and I just don't feel like changing the
terminal emulator for no reason.

## Discaimer
Some of the configs in there where not created by me. I try to give credits to
the creators, but if i've missed one, please tell me\
If you think that you might like this configs try it out and tell me where you
think i could improve them.

# Dotfiles
My most important config files

## Distro
I've used Arch, Mint, Debian and Ubuntu, now I'm trying OpenSUSE. Debian and
OpenSUSE are the ones I like the most, Debian is used everywhere and it's easy
to follow guides, while OpenSUSE with BTRFS is amazing and I rarely need to
build anything manually.

## Nvim

## Discaimer
Some of the configs in there were not created by me. I try to give credit to
the creators, but if I've missed one, please tell me. If you think that you
might like this config try it out and tell me where you think i could improve
them.
